# parkingdetection

This is a project for our Natural Image Processing class. This code is made using Python and uses Google Colab as its medium. Do make sure to install openCV and pyyaml before applying this method.

The footage used is our university's own parking lot.

Since the file of the parking footage is too large, feel free to download the parking lot file from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xR1pGVKkXjmoF6P8QlBOFpLXZnKCqSzi?usp=sharing
